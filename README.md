# Things used

[Anilist](https://anilist.co/home) - "The [AniList GraphQL Api](https://github.com/AniList) provides quick and powerful access to over 500k anime and manga entries, including character, staff, and live airing data. The AniList & AniChart websites themselves run on the Api, so everything you can do on the sites, you can do via the Api."

[discord-rpc-csharp](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) - "This is a C# implementation of the Discord RPC library which was originally written in C++. This avoids having to use the official C++ and instead provides a managed way of using the Rich Presence within the .NET environment."
